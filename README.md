# H1B changes and impact on Software Engineers

### Exploration  
The Trump Administratin has changed some requirements for the H1B visa
applicants making it harder for a large proportion of them to even be eligible
for the application. The main basis of this change is the increase in the
income threshold so that many people will not meet the minimum criteria. In this
project, I am going to explore the annual salaries of Software Engineers in the
United States that has been collected from multiple sources like Glassdoor,
LinkedIn Salaries, and StackOverflow Survey 2020. With this data, I am going to
explore exactly what proportion of non-immigrant Software Engineers will be
affected.

### Conclusion
As much as half of the non-immigrant Software Engineers employed in the United
States will be affected. The highest number of Software Engineers work at either
big tech companies or consultancy companies. Since big tech companies already
pay a huge sum to their Software Engineers, they will be hardly affected, but
these consultancy companies which employ a lot of people will be heavily
affected as they will not  be able to match the renewed requirements for all the
employees. Additionally, it is worth noting that Startups do not even make a
mark in the data collected. These companies also do not have the ability to pay
at that scale dictateed by the new rule, so they will be heavily impacted as
well.
